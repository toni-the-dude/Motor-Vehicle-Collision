# Motor-Vehicle-Collision

## Overview

<p>This project was made following the 2-hour long Coursera guided project <a href="https://www.coursera.org/projects/data-science-streamlit-python">"Build a Data Science Web App with Streamlit and Python"</a>.</p>
<p>It is a dashboard that graphically represents data regarding motor vehicle collisions in New York City in various formats. The dataset was released some time ago by the New York City police department and it consists of 1.67 million rows and 29 columns.</p>

## Usage

<p>To run this application, go to the /app directory and run the command "streamlit run main.py". This will open the application on the ports specified in the terminal. All the dependencies are listed within "requirements.txt".</p>

## Showcase

<p>The dashboard can be broken down into the following sections:</p>

<ol>
  <li>2D Map</li>
  <p>This shows where <b>at least n</b> people were injured on a 2D map, where n is determined by the slider.</p>

  <li>3D Map</li>
  <p>This shows where and how many collisions occur during a given time of day within a 3D map.</p>
  
  ![3dmap](https://github.com/toni-the-dude/Motor-Vehicle-Collision/blob/main/.misc/showcase3.PNG?raw=true)
  <li>Histogram</li>
  <p>The previous data is further broken down, now in histogram format, in order to showcase accidents by the minute within the given hour.</p>

  <li>Top 5</li>
  <p>A query to the dataset that returns the top 5 most dangerous places to be as a pedestrian, cyclist or motorist, judging by the data.</p>
